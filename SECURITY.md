## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Luna team and community take all security bugs in Luna seriously. 
Thank you for improving the security of Luna. We appreciate your efforts and responsible disclosure and will manke every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

Report vulnerabilities by emailing the lead maintainer at barnev@rpi.edu.

The lead maintainer will acknowledge your email within 48 hours, and will send a more detailed response within 48 hours indicating the next steps
in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will endeavor to keep you informed of the progress towards a fix
and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

When the security team recieves a security bug report, they will assign it to a primary handler. This person will coordinate the fix and release process,
involving the following steps:
- Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
- Audit code to find any potential similar problems.
- Prepare fixes for all releases still under maintenance. These fixes will be released as fast as possible to npm.

Report vulnerabilities and security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining that module.

If you have suggestions on how this process could be improved please submit a pull request.

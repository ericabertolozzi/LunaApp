README for Lab 1

Helena's Work Log:
 For Lab 1, I assisted with gathering a portion of the 200 XML articles. Once I
 found them, I converted the XML articles to JSON and added the news items 
 to the news.json file. I found and converted the news articles during a
 Visual Studio Live Share.

 In addition, I helped with the creative aspect of the webpage for Lab 1.
 I moved the timestamp and added some stylistic elements (lines) to the
 index.html file. I also changed the date format using the toLocaleString()
 method.

 Development Process:
  During the entire process of the lab, I didn't get stuck with any specific
  part of it. I found that the work that I did for the lab to be very reasonable. 
  
  
  Simi's Work Log: 
  
  For Lab1 I also worked on gathering the 200 articles from XML and into the Json file. I did this on visual studio code using different RSS our team found. 
  This was very similar to a lab we had completed in web systems so it was okay.

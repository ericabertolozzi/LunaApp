Team Luna Lab 4 README

API Description -

For the external API, we used the Spotify API. A clientid and clientsecret id were used to get access to
this API. A GET request was used to display the top three songs of an artist input by the user. This data was 
displayed on the /v1/singers/returnsong route.  A POST request was used to simply display the 
artist the user entered in the form. This data was displayed on /v1/singer page. There are two 
forms for each of these respective calls on the homepage. In addition to the GET and POST request, 
a DELETE and PUT request were also implemented. 



Individual Work Logs
--------------------

Erica Bertolozzi (@ericabertolozzi):
For this lab, I provided support for PUT and DELETE requests in the server.js file. 
For creativity, in one of the paths for making a delete request, I added regular expression (regex) 
middleware for typing in a user id that ends in the letter 'a' with any amount of letters before.

Helena's Work Log: (@osullh)
 For Lab 4, I helped with the HTML/CSS and the overall styling of the project. During the entire
 process of the lab, I only really got stuck on getting Angular
 and Node to communicate as I kept getting error messages, but aside from that I
 understood what to do. Overall, I found that the work that I did for the lab to
 be very reasonable. For individual creativity, I added graphical elements to the lab
 (split background).

I helped in setting up the front end in Angular. In the beginning while transforming the code into 
Angular, there was a problem in that server.js file did not appear to be connecting properly. 
I was able to solve this problem with the help of the TA. For creativity, Â I added styling 
and design to the POST redirect page which display the artist that the singer inputs in the form box.

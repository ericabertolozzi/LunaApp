Erica Bertolozzi (@ericabertolozzi):
For this lab, I provided support for PUT and DELETE requests in the server.js file. 
For creativity, in one of the paths for making a delete request, I added regular expression (regex) 
middleware for typing in a user id that ends in the letter 'a' with any amount of letters before.

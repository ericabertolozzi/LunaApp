 For Lab 3, I helped with the initial setup of the Spotify API during LiveShare.
 I also added a couple of HTML/CSS elements to the landing page as well.

I helped with obtaining the keys to access the Spotify API through my personal Spotify account.
I also added a route parameterized URL to our application so users can type in any artist name in
the URL and see their top tracks. I was mostly confused by how our application is supposed to offer an
API while also using the external Spotify API.

I helped with creating the form where the user would input an artist name. Through a POST call, I was 
able to save this form data into a variable that would then be fed into the Spotify API call. I 
also worked on the HTML/CSS for the landing page. I was mostly confused on how write the correct 
route for the Get and Post request so it would print the correct information on the right page.

I helped with setting up the Spotify Web API and retrieving the access token on the server js file.
When setting up the access token, Virginia and I were confused on how to retrieve the correct access 
token. After reaching out to Dr. Callahan, we realized that we had to set up a small time delay,
since it was accessing the token too quickly before the token could refresh.

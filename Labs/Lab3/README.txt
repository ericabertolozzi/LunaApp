 For Lab 3, I helped with the initial setup of the Spotify API during LiveShare.
 I also added a couple of HTML/CSS elements to the landing page as well.

I helped with obtaining the keys to access the Spotify API through my personal Spotify account.
I also added a route parameterized URL to our application so users can type in any artist name in
the URL and see their top tracks. I was mostly confused by how our application is supposed to offer an
API while also using the external Spotify API.

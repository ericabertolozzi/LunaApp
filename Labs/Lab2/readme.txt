Group Work Log:
Our first step was reviewing the Openweathermap API to see the type of data it contained. There were several different ways to get the weather of the current location including by zip code, city name, and geolocation. We decided to use the HTML geolocation feature to retrieve the user’s location and specifically their latitude and longitude. These values were then fed into the API URL. The next step involved printing the results of the API call onto the webpage. This was accomplished by making div ID’s in the HTML page for each of the various data points. Then, in the JavaScript file we assigned the API weather data to each of the respective ID tags. The data that was collected from the API included: city name, temperature, feels like temperature, icon of weather description and description, humidity, pressure, maximum and minimum temperature.

I worked on the js file adding tempMin, tempMax and pressure to this file. I also added the divs into html and css.

luna is a period tracker application with a subtle design that users of all ages and genders can feel safe using. The application is built using the MEAN stack. 

Users can use luna to learn about menstruation and shop for products that they need. Users can also track their periods, symptoms, and moods directly on luna with our built-in tracker. There is also a calendar that users can add events to and track their periods easier. luna currently allows users to register for an account and login with it. Login is secure using the npm bcrypt package that secures hashes passwords before being stored in the database. A session is created for each user upon login, but as of right now the login is not reflected on the front end, and only recognized on the server.
